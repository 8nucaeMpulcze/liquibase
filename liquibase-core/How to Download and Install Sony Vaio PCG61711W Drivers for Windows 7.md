One option is to use a third-party software that can scan your laptop and automatically download and install the compatible drivers for your device. There are many such programs available online, but you should be careful to choose a reputable and safe one. Some of them may contain malware or unwanted programs that can harm your laptop or compromise your privacy. You should also read the user reviews and ratings before downloading any software.
 
Another option is to manually download and install the drivers from other sources. You can try to search for the drivers on other websites that offer driver downloads, such as DriverGuide, DriverEasy, or DriverPack Solution. However, you should be aware that these websites are not affiliated with Sony and may not have the official or updated drivers for your laptop. You should also check the driver details and compatibility before downloading and installing them. You should also create a backup of your system and data before making any changes to your laptop.
 
A third option is to use the Windows Update feature to check for any available updates for your laptop. Windows Update can sometimes detect and install the drivers you need automatically. To use this option, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the Start button and type "Windows Update" in the search box.
2. Click on "Windows Update" from the list of results.
3. Click on "Check for updates" and wait for Windows to scan your laptop.
4. If there are any updates available, click on "Install updates" and follow the instructions.
5. Restart your laptop when prompted.
